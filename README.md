1. Start the Mock Server
Install Node.js:

Ensure that Node.js (version 16.17.0 or higher) is installed on your system.
Run the Server:

Navigate to the directory containing main.js.
Execute the command:
node main.js

The server should start and listen on port 3000. Youâ€™ll see a message like:

TCP server started on port 3000.
Verify Server Readiness:

The server will handle incoming connections and simulate the behavior of a stock exchange.
2. Compile and Run the C# Client
Set Up the Environment:

Use an IDE like Visual Studio or a text editor with a C# compiler.

Compile the Client:

Save the provided C# code in a file, e.g., ABXClient.cs.
Compile the code:

dotnet build

Run the Client:

Execute the client to connect to the server:

dotnet run

Observe the Output:

The client should:
Connect to the server.
Receive stock ticker data packets.
Detect missing sequences.
Request and retrieve the missing packets.
Save the complete data in output.json.

3. Validate the JSON Output
Check the File:

Open the output.json file generated by the client.
It should contain an array of objects, with each object representing a packet:

[
  {
   "Symbol": "MSFT",
    "BuySellIndicator": "B",
    "Quantity": 50,
    "Price": 100,
    "PacketSequence": 1
  },
  {
    "Symbol": "AAPL",
    "BuySellIndicator": "S",
    "Quantity": 30,
    "Price": 200,
    "PacketSequence": 2
  }
]
